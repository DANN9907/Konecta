## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook focuses on leveraging generative AI skills to analyze and interact with a dataset, particularly extracted from a catalog-like PDF. The notebook showcases methods to read, process, and query the data using advanced AI techniques. It utilizes libraries like LangChain for document processing and OpenAI's GPT models for generating responses to user queries.

## Structure

The notebook is organized into several key sections:

1. **Setup and Imports**:
    - Essential libraries are imported, including `LangChain`, `OpenAI`, and other supportive Python libraries.
    
2. **Reading and Processing Data**:
    - The notebook reads a PDF file, processes the text, and stores it in a format suitable for querying.
    
3. **Generating AI Responses**:
    - This section sets up the environment to use OpenAI's GPT model for generating responses to user queries.
    - It involves creating a prompt template and configuring a conversational chain to handle interactions.

4. **Querying the Data**:
    - Several example queries are run against the processed data to demonstrate the capabilities of the setup.
    - The notebook answers questions about product details, dermatological testing of products, and specific catalog entries.

## Key Functions and Components

- **LangChain Setup**:
    - Used to create a pipeline for processing and querying documents.
    - Key components include `ConversationBufferMemory` for maintaining chat history and `load_qa_chain` for loading a question-answering chain.

- **Prompt Template**:
    - A template is defined for the AI to generate consistent and relevant responses based on the user input and context.
    
- **Example Queries**:
    - The notebook demonstrates querying the document database with questions like product availability, dermatological testing, and specific details from the catalog.

## How to Use

1. **Pre-requisites**:
    - Ensure you have the necessary API keys and library installations for OpenAI and LangChain.
    
2. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Execute the cells in order to set up the environment and load the data.
    - Interact with the example queries or modify them as needed to suit your specific requirements.

3. **Customize Queries**:
    - Modify the `questions` list to include any queries you want to run against the dataset.
    - Observe the responses generated by the AI and adjust the prompt template if necessary for improved results.

## Example Queries

Here are some example queries demonstrated in the notebook:

- "¿Que colonias tienes de Disney?"
- "¿Cual es la religión más practican en Colombia?"
- "¿Hay alguna colonia o producto que sea dermatológicamente probado?"
- "¿Qué venden en la última página del PDF?"

## Conclusion

This notebook is a comprehensive guide to using generative AI for document analysis and querying. By following the setup and examples provided, users can adapt the notebook to various document types and query requirements, enhancing their ability to extract meaningful information using AI.

## Dependencies

- `openai`
- `langchain`
- `pdfplumber` (or any other PDF processing library)
- `nbformat`
- `IPython.display` for Jupyter notebook interactions
